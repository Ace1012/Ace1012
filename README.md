- 👋 Hi, I’m Antony Rapando.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the both front and backend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a full-stack combination of React.ts, Expressjs/Springboot, Nodejs and MongoDB/PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects that will allow me to grow as a developer and gain a deeper understanding
      of how the coolest projects I've seen work.
